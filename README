1. introduction
---------------
Welcome to my small port scanner project. I decided to start
developing a basic port scanner in C++ mainly for educational
reasons. It is based on C++ code and I share this code with
everyone.


2. Project Status
-----------------
This project is currently under development. Do not expect to
see running code here all the time. I do my best to just commit
working code, but sometimes it is just not possible.


3. Contribution
---------------
If you like to contribute to my project, I would be interested
to hear from you. Just let me know and drop me a message.


I post important updates to this project here.

Thank you,
André Gasser
